# [WP Tally Connect](http://wptally.com) #

WP Tally Connect is a plugin to integrate with the WP Tally API and display a users plugin download count on their website. For details on the WP Tally API, please visit [our website](http://wptally.com/api-docs).

## Goals ##

* Creation of a widget which displays user download counts
* Widget should be flexible enough to show/hide details
* Propose three built-in styles
  1. Standard (text based)
  2. Goal (allow defining a target and display a 'thermometer')
  3. Count Up (a jQuery-powered count-up display [example](http://bfintal.github.io/Counter-Up/demo/demo.html)
* Creation of a shortcode with the same options
